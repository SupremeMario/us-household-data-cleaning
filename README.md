# us-household-data-cleaning

This project contains the data cleaning process applied to a real-world US household income dataset.  
The focus is on identifying and handling missing values, correcting data inconsistencies, and preparing the dataset for further analysis.  

All cleaning steps and SQL queries used in this project are included for transparency and reproducibility.

The pure SQL code is also available in US_Household_Income_Cleaning.md, which I created in case the original SQL file is too large to preview.
